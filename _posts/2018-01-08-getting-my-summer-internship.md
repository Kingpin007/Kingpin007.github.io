It has been a long time since my last blog post and frankly, my laziness is to blame for it.
  
On 4th September, 2017 Walmart Labs came to my college campus for summer interships. They offered a total of 5 positions and I was among the lucky 5.

I cleared the 1st round as the only person who had solved the programming question in my college. I was thus automatically selected to the next round which was an HR round.

I am pretty excited for my internship which is scheduled to begin in May. The exact date has not yet been provided to me but i expect that it will be after i complete my 6th semester in my college.
