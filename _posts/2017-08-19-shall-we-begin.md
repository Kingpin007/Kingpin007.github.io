> Today is the 19th of August, 2017 and finally I have completed setting up my 2nd blog. This is the first time I have set up a site not for financial gain but for actual blogging.

_As some of you may know, my previous technology blog : [DigitalMachine](http://digitalmachine.in) was a complete failure. I had set up that sire with my friend Rishab Sarda who is running his own designing agency. We parted ways in ways that I personally regret, I wish I could go back in time and change what I said, all I can say now is that I am sorry and in hindsight I should not have been so rude._

## Why create a blog?

  1. Every programmer should have his own blog, this is my belief.
  2. The programmer should write his personal experiences while building a project so that others may benefit from his prior experience.
  3. Writing code is very exciting when you know what you are doing and what you need to do. It is hell when you have no idea how to proceed when you get stuck on a problem. This is where blogs like this, which detail experiences of programmers who were stuck on problems and how they tackled those issues are very helpful.
  4. This blog will help me recount my life, because as I have grown older I realized that soon I will forget many people and many problems I have faced throughout my school life and college life. Along with the problems I might forget the hope and determination I had to endure through those problems. I don&#8217;t want to lose my experiences and memories. This blog will document them.

## What should you expect to find in this blog?

Currently I am mostly doing competitive programming on websites like:

  1. [CodeChef](https://codechef.com)
  2. [SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com)
  3. [CodeForces](http://codeforces.com/)

I am also learning to develop Android Apps online. I will be posting the code for my submissions and detailing how I solved them here after every contest ends on the respective sites. I will also be posting the apps that I have made here.
