> Well finally I have migrated my website blog which was previously a WordPress blog into Jekyll. This website is hosted on Github Pages thus reducing my server costs to 0. Overall maintaining a high quality customizable and hackable blog has never been easier or cheaper.

Setting up a Jekyll blog is reallt simple. All you need to do is fork Jekyll Now to your User Repository and rename it to _yourusername.github.io_ and you are all set. Just follow the instructions in readme.md and you should be good to go.
